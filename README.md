# What I Learned In Week 0 at Code Immersives

### Introduction

You're going to use this repository to document what you learned in Week 0. This won't be a simple list, though--you're going to have to dive a little deeper and explain each concept to a layperson. Specifically, you'll explain the concept to yourself from the previous week!

This is a great way to:
* Review the concepts.
* Learn by teaching.
* And practice your content creation skills.


### How Deep You Should Go

You're NOT writing a manual, here. It doesn't have to be as detailed as a cheatsheet! More specifically, you can talk about things in plain English.

Explain it to your self from before you started. That student from a week ago didn't have the underlying knowledge to know what `bash` or `git` or markdown are, which means you'll have to explain things GENERALLY, avoiding specific terminology whenever possible.

Don't worry too much about the format overall, though. This is our first time, and we'll converge on a common style for this as we go!


### Tools You'll Practice

* bash
* git
* markdown


### Directions

You're going to explain the tools from the Tools You'll Practice section above, while using those tools!

1. Create a NEW GitHub repository on their website, making _sure_ not to check the "initialize this repository with a README" option. Call it `what-i-learned-in-week-0` (kebab case!).
2. Make a directory with the same name as that repo.
3. `cd` into that directory, create a new file there called `README.md` (with the first part in all caps!), and open it in Code.
4. Use markdown to explain one concept to yourself from last week.
5. Being SURE to be in the `what-i-learned-in-week-0` directory, run:
   1. `git init`
   2. `git remote add origin [url from GitHub for the repository you created]`
6. Send what you've got so far to the repo.
   1. `git add .`
   2. `git commit -m [message]` (don't forget a descriptive message!)
   3. `git push -u origin master`.
7. Now explain another concept.
8. Push up without having to set the upstream:
   1. `git add .`
   2. `git commit -m [message]` (don't forget a descriptive message!)
   3. `git push`.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 until you've covered everything we've learned since Tuesday!
